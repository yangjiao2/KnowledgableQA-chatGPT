# Mint troubleshooting

Mint is a package manager like `brew`, `bundle`, `apt-get`
https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint

The applications it manages are listed in the [Mintfile](../../Mintfile)

# Running Mint bootstrap

Will then use `brew` to install `mint`. It will then install the
compatible versions of our required (swift based) command line tools linking
them into `/usr/local/bin`. 

If you have mint already installed you can obtain verbose output by running it like so:

```bash
mint bootstrap --link --verbose
```

### Skip linking (advanced)
You can skip linking by passing `--no-link` you will
then need to run the tools by using the `mint run` prefix (since they are
unlikely to be in your $PATH)

## Common Errors

### Script Hangs
This script uses `git+ssh` to clone some internal tools. Ensure you've setup
your ssh keys for `gecgithub01.walmart.com`. You can validate your setup by
running `ssh -T git@gecgithub01.walmart.com`)

### Failed to resolve `glass-swift-scripts`

This isn't necessarily a mint issue, but it is prone to happen when running `./scripts/setup-mint.sh`, the issue originates from
Xcode build tools but it _looks_ as if was caused by `mint`, output is the following:

```bash
# ... other output ...

```

To fix it make sure to have installed the recommended Xcode version from the main readme and in the terminal that is
running mint set the Xcode location:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
