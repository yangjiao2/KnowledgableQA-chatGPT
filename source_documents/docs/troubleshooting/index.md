## How to Troubleshoot Issues in the Glass Project

A step-by-step guide for effectively troubleshooting issues in the Glass iOS project.

### 1. Ask your teammates or team lead for help

Start by asking a peer on your team or reaching out to your team in your team's slack channel. 

Ask your team lead, tech lead, or manager for guidance.

### 2. Search slack for similiar questions/issues

Use slack's search feature or read through the recent channel history in the [#glass-ios](https://walmart.slack.com/archives/C011N0KG7K9) and [#glass-platform-ios-announcements](https://walmart.slack.com/archives/C04MVJJC92N) slack channels. Chances are others have the same question or issue and answers/solutions have already been documented in the channel.

### 3. Read the [documentation](../index.md) 

The glass project is well-documented and many common questions can be answered by reading the docs on the topic related to your question.

Make sure you have read the [Onboarding](../onboarding/index.md) docs if you are new to the project.

The [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) and [FAQs](../faqs/index.md) guides contain solutions and helpful information for common issues like CI issues, test failures, build failures, and GlassCLI issues.

### 4. Ask a question for the broader Glass team in the #glass-ios channel

Post a question in the [#glass-ios](https://walmart.slack.com/archives/C011N0KG7K9) channel (do not use @here or tag @glass-platform-ios team). There's lots of knowledgeable folks on other teams that are willing to help answer questions.

Use Xcode Authors, git blame, or the CODEOWNERS file to find the right team to reach out to for questions about code and help with test failures.
