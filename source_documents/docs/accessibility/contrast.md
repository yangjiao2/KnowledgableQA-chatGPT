# Color and Contrast

The color contrast ratio allows a user to distinguish text on a background, and Walmart UX designers are able to use a higher ratio for better separation between elements, use color to make sure text on a background is legible, or buttons are easily discovered. The designers audited all the colors used in the app and reduced them to a more manageable number so that they were more consistent and to ensure proper contrast was always possible, while still keeping enough colors for each featureâ€™s design vision.

## Higher Contrast for Legibility

As per [iOS Human Interface Guidelines:](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/)

use sufficient color contrast ratios. Insufficient contrast in the app makes content hard to read for everyone. Icons and text might blend with the background, for example. An online color contrast calculator can help accurately analyze the color contrast in the app, to ensure that it meets optimal standards. Strive for a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1, although 7:1 is preferred because it meets more stringent [accessibility standards.](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-reqs)

## Contrast Checker Tools

There's a wide selection of contrast checker tools we can use to check if the color and font choices meet the minimun contrast ratio.
