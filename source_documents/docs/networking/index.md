# Networking

For an end-to-end demonstration of the Glass networking best practices covered in this documentation, head over to the [`WalmartPlatformExtensions` sample app](https://gecgithub01.walmart.com/walmart-ios/glass-app/tree/development/Modules/WalmartPlatformExtensions/WalmartPlatformExtensionsApp/Sources). You can run it locally using the `WalmartPlatformExtensionsApp` scheme.
