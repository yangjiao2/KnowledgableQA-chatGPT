# **GlassCLI Automatic Update Interceptor**

## **Overview**
The automatic update interceptor allows GlassCLI to detect if the user is on the correct version of GlassCLI for the commit of the mono repo they are checked out to. If it finds that the user is not on the appropriate version, it will run the install script on their behalf.

## **What if this causes my command to fail?**
This is by design, run the failed command again.
